OATH for OpenBSD
Developed in Jan - Feb, 2014 by Dennis Lindroos <denafcm@gmail.com>


RECENT:
* OTP window; hard-coded because i don't know how to get login(1) to pass me
              proper -v optiona
* HOTP is now build-time default, but when called as login_totp will go TOTP
* strsep replaces strtok, as recommended

TODO:
* Challenge mode ?

Keys-file format:

* Field separator can be '|', ':', space or tab
* First is the PIN-code (see PIN_LENGTH define)
* Second is the 160-bit SHA1 message digest in hexadecimal
* Third is the current counter, a 64-bit integer in hex

NOTE! OpenBSD 5.8 makemap(1) produces db files where keys INCLUDE the
null-terminating '\0'. To you these db files, compile this program with
-DNULL_TERMINATED.
